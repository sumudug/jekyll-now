## Custom Domain

I've just configured a custom domain for this site. I used a sub domain from one of my already registered domains. First thing I did was to add a CNAME record in the cloudflare, where I host all of my domains. After that, I went back to Github and added the customs domain in CNAME file. Viola! in less than a minute everything was up & running. 

Now I am posting this from **Prose** web app that apprently supports Jekyll. Prose UI seems to be much more user friendly than posting directly from Github.That's said, will have to see how this post comes up on the website.

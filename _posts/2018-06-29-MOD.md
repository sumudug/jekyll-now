Flight Attendants have been using a mobile device with a inhouse developed software since last 18 months or so. Though, it has only been used in one cabin on the aircraft, there has been quite a bit of hype.
Some people within the organiztion, even started a project to make use of the meal choice data for prediction of optimum number of meal choices to be loaded onto the aircraft, using ML. 
With all this going on, last week, there has been a slight mention of change to the current MOD solution, quoting that when the flight attendants are busy with their iDevices in the cabin taking food & drinks orders, they invairably loss eye-contact with the customers. I have to agree that is true and it dwoul be interesting to watch this space to see what potential solutions out there to address the current situation.

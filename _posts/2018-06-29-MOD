Flight Attendants have been using a mobile device with a inhouse developed software since last 18 months or so. Though, it has only been used in one cabin on the aircraft, there has been quite a bit of hype.
Some people within the organiztion, even started a project to make use of the meal choice data for prediction of optimum number of meal choices to be loaded onto the aircraft, using ML. 
With all this going on, last week, there has been a slight mention of change to the current MOD solution. It will be interesting to watch this space.

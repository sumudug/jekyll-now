Over the last couple of months, I have been reading and hearing so much stuff about indieweb movement in the interwebs. 
Jason has been trying to put something together in terms of 10Cv5,which apprently will meet not only indieweb standards; but even more, for instance compliance to recently implemented GDPR.  Most of the work has been progressed on v5 and I've been forunate to gained early access to 10Cv5 beta in mid-May this year. 
While I already have web presence in a couple of places, particulalry with 10C platform, one might think, why another web page here for me. Even I wonder sometimes. I guess it's partly my passion for tech and curiosity to try out new things, when it comes to technology and interwebs.
